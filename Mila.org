* What am I doing?
  The idea of literate programing holds obvious attractions; the idea
  of literate DevOps even more so: in theory, an enitre site can be
  constructed from one well written Org-mode file, and even a complete
  testing/development environment that mirrors the site can be spun up
  with just a few keystrokes. For me, this idea went from hopeful
  Google term to something approaching reality when I stumbled across
  [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html][this blog post]].
*** Preliminary steps:
    1. Create project directory, create this file inside of it.
    2. Create a Vagrantfile in this directory for dev/testing
    3. Incorporate Vagrantfile into this document
    4. Use steps divined for Vagrantfile to configure production
       server on Digital Ocean
    5. Profit!!!
